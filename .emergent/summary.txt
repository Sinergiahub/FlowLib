The trajectory details the development of the FlowLib application, an automation workflow management web app, by an AI engineer. The project commenced with an initial MVP build (Dashboard, Template Library, Search/Filters, Detail Pages) using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, incorporating a modern dark theme and Shadcn UI. Subsequent phases included implementing a CSV import backend for templates, refining the template detail modal, adding a GPT Agents section, and finally, introducing comprehensive authentication with user roles and visual adjustments. The latest and ongoing critical task involves migrating the entire backend data layer from MongoDB to Supabase PostgreSQL, while maintaining existing API contracts and frontend compatibility, alongside resolving some frontend import validation issues. The user expressed frustration over credit consumption on incomplete tasks, emphasizing the need for a complete and functional delivery for the Supabase migration.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a responsive web application named FlowLib (initially AutomaçãoHub) for managing automation flows (n8n, Make, Zapier).

**Core Features:**
*   **User Authentication:** Email/password login, Google OAuth2, password recovery. User roles (Admin, Pro, Free) with access rules for viewing, downloading, and admin functions.
*   **Dashboard:** Highlights for trending automations, search bar with autocomplete, sidebar filters (Platform, Category, Tools, Tags).
*   **Automation Library:** Responsive cards displaying Name, Short Description, Author, Tags, Tools. Each card links to a detail page.
*   **Detail Page:** Full Name, Description, Author, Publication Date, Tools used, Flow Preview (image/diagram), Video Tutorial (YouTube link/player), Action buttons (Use Template, Download JSON/YAML, View Tutorial), Metrics (downloads, ratings, favorites).
*   **User Contribution:** Upload new templates (JSON/YAML) with admin approval workflow. Author credits visible.
*   **Admin Panel (Planned):** CRUD for templates, categories, tools. Approval workflow (draft, pending, approved, rejected). CSV import with preview, Google Sheets integration. Role-based access.
*   **Data Structure:** Users, Templates, Categories, Tools, Downloads, Favorites tables with relationships.
*   **Design & UX:** Modern card-based layout (Sabrina.dev inspired), automatic Dark/Light mode, clean/intuitive UI, responsive grid, featured automation carousel. Centralized hero section, global footer.
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python). Initially MongoDB, migrating to Supabase PostgreSQL. REST API.
*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI.
*   **Import CSV Backend:** Endpoint to mass import templates via CSV (upsert/delete by slug), with validation and a JSON report.
*   **Telemetry:** Tracking for download events and agent clicks.

**Current State & Nuances:**
The application has a functional frontend with a homepage displaying mock templates, search, filters, and a polished detail modal. A GPT Agents section and a global footer are implemented. Authentication with email/password and user roles (Admin, Buyer, Registered, Anon) is set up, with Google OAuth prepared but disabled. The backend currently uses MongoDB and has CSV import/preview endpoints. The immediate task is to migrate the backend to Supabase PostgreSQL.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently tasked with a significant backend migration: transitioning the database from MongoDB to Supabase PostgreSQL. This follows a period where the user experienced issues with incomplete tasks and credit consumption.

The user explicitly requested:
1.  **Confirmation of MongoDB dependencies:** Identify where MongoDB drivers, variables, and collections are used in the current backend.
2.  **Migration to Supabase:**
    *   Update  with Supabase credentials and other environment variables.
    *   Define the Supabase SQL schema for , , and  tables.
    *   Rewrite the data access layer to use  (v2) instead of /.
    *   Reimplement existing API endpoints ( with filters, pagination, facets; , , , , , , ) to work with Supabase.
3.  **CSV Importer Adjustments:**
    *   Maintain current  and  behavior.
    *   Enforce  and  as mandatory CSV columns, and  as required.
    *   Handle  and  in CSV as pipe-separated values that convert to  arrays in Postgres.
    *   Return the same JSON report format (, , , ).
    *   Add a CSV Specification block and a download example CSV button to the  UI.
4.  **Admin Authentication:** Implement minimal Supabase Auth (email/password) for admin protection, or leave clear s if budget is a concern.
5.  **CORS and Frontend :** Ensure CORS is configured for localhost and the preview domain, and update the frontend  for .

The AI engineer has acknowledged the user's concerns about previous incomplete tasks and explicitly stated the intention to deliver a complete and functional solution, starting with the installation of the  library.
